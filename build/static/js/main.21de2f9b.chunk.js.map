In a technology business, much or even most of the\r\n                                            value of the business may lie in the intellectual property that it owns or\r\n                                            controls. While this asset value is significant, the main role of\r\n                                            intellectual property is usually to support the commercial strategy of the\r\n                                            business. It is therefore very important to understand what intellectual\r\n                                            property is needed by a business to support its commercial strategy, so that\r\n                                            the business can make good decisions about identifying and securing the\r\n                                            intellectual property that it needs as efficiently as possible.\r\n                                        </Typography>\r\n                                    </Col>\r\n                                </Row>\r\n                            </Box>\r\n\r\n                            {/** Divider */}\r\n                            <Box marginY=\"30px\">\r\n                                <Divider/>\r\n                            </Box>\r\n\r\n                            {/** Tips */}\r\n                            <Box display=\"flex\" flexDirection=\"column\">\r\n                                <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"left\">Top 5 Things You Need to Know</Typography>\r\n                                <Box height=\"20px\"/>\r\n                                <Typography variant=\"body1\" align=\"left\" component=\"span\">\r\n                                    <ol>\r\n                                        <li>\r\n                                            There are four main forms of IP Protection\r\n                                            <br/>\r\n                                            <ol type=\"a\">\r\n                                                <li><i>Patents</i> for technological innovations,</li>\r\n                                                <li><i>Trademarks</i> for branding,</li>\r\n                                                <li><i>Registered</i> Designs for the look and feel of a product,</li>\r\n                                                <li><i>Copyright</i> for creative works such as instruction manuals or\r\n                                                    software code.\r\n                                                </li>\r\n                                            </ol>\r\n                                        </li>\r\n                                        <br/>\r\n                                        <li>\r\n                                            Registered vs. unregistered rights\r\n                                            <br/>\r\n                                            <ul>\r\n                                                <li>\r\n                                                    There are differences in strength of registered vs unregistered\r\n                                                    rights, as well as their costs and timescales.
